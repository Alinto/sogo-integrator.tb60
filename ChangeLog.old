2013-11-12  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* added the capability to synchronize mail labels from and to
	  SOGo using DAV requests.

2012-07-10  Jean Raby  <jraby@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/calendar/calendar-overlay.js	(openCalendarUnsubscriptionDialog):
	Re-add calendar deletion function so that the 'Delete Calendar' icon works again.

	* chrome/content/calendar/folder-handler.js: handle
	"{urn:inverse:params:xml:ns:inverse-dav}calendar-show-alarms".

2012-02-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/addressbook/folder-handler.js
	(AddressbookHandler.prototype._moveAddressBook): fixed to properly
	handle the transfer of lists.

	* chrome/content/preferences/preferences-overlay.js: added code to
	synchronise classification preferences to server when modified.

	* chrome/content/messenger/folders-update.js (checkFolders):
	synchronise the classification preferences at launch time.

	* chrome/content/calendar/default-classifications.js: new module
	that handles synchronisation of the default classification
	preferences.

2012-02-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/calendar/calendar-overlay.js: we now directly
	override "promptDeleteCalendar", as it may be called from the

	* chrome/content/calendar/folder-handler.js

2012-02-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/general/subscription-utils.js (escapedUsername):
	substitutes "+" with "_SP_" as in SOGo 2.

	* chrome/content/calendar/folder-handler.js (addDirectories): the
	calendar properties must be set BEFORE the calendar registration,
	due to improvements in Lightning 1.0b3 (vanilla) with regards to
	instantiation of cached calendars.
	(_setDirectoryProperties): thanks to the change above, it is no
	longer required to force a refetch of the calendar ACL entry after
	modifying its provider class. The mechanism did not work anyway
	due to other problems.

	* chrome/content/calendar/calendar-overlay.js
	(managerCalendarACL): force a refresh of the calendar, in order to
	force a redraw of its associated display blocks and a renewal of
	their associated events. This futher forces the event acl entries
	to be refreshed when edited or displayed.

	* chrome/content/calendar/folder-handler.js
	(CalendarHandler._setDirectoryProperties): restored setting
	calendars as cached.

	* chrome/content/headerview-overlay.js: new overlay that

	button in mail header display.

	"response" is not null before processing it, otherwise mark result

	handler, since the "search" text fields now handle this properly
	for us.

	* chrome/content/calendar/roles-dialog.js (onDAVQueryComplete),
	chrome/content/addressbook/roles-dialog.js (onDAVQueryComplete):
	ensure that "response" is not null before invoking "indexOf" on it.

	* chrome/content/addressbook/newcard-overlay.js
	(SIOnNewCardOverlayLoad): adapted to new ab API.

2012-02-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/messenger/startup-overlay.js,
	chrome/content/messenger/update-dialog.js: updated to the new
	AddonManager API.

	(checkAvailability): create a new reference to "this" for the
	callback function.

	* chrome/content/messenger/startup-overlay.js: temporarily
	disabled update code.

2012-02-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

2012-01-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/addressbook/addressbook-overlay.js
	(SIOnLoadHandler): checkAvailability is now callback based, we
	therefore must enable the toolbar via a callback function.

2011-12-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/calendar/calendars-list-overlay.js
	(SICalendarListTreeController.isCommandEnabled): directoryChecker
	is now callback based, when first invoked, provide a proper
	"yesCallback" and reinvoke the command check to properly enable
	our custom menus.

	* chrome/content/messenger/folders-update.js:
	(directoryChecker.checkAvailability) invoke "yesCallback" only
	when set.

2011-11-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/calendar/folder-handler.js
	(CalendarHandler.addDirectories): pass "true" as value to the new
	"useCache" parameter to calCalendarManager.registerCalendar.

2011-11-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/messenger/folders-update.js
	(directoryChecker.checkAvailability): made asynchronous to avoid
	blocking the network thread.

2011-03-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/calendar/calendar-overlay.js
	(openCalendarUnsubscriptionDialog): Fixed typo in function named
	and included confirmation code from calendar-common-sets.js for
	unsubscriptions.

	* chrome/content/calendar/calendar-common-sets.{js,xul}: removed
	obsolete files.

	* chrome/content/general/creation-utils.js

	* chrome/content/addressbook/folder-handler.js:
	(AddressbookHandler._moveAddressBook): add cloned versions of the
	cards to avoid raising their reference count, which otherwise
	prevents their proper deletion.

2010-11-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/addressbook/folder-handler.js:
	(AddressbookHandler._moveAddressBook): new method, derived from
	sogo-connector's previous SCCopyAddressBook method, with added
	code to remove copied cards.
	(AddressbookHandler._ensureFolderIsremote): invoke
	_moveAddressBook so that cards are deleted, even though we
	expected the addressbook file to be properly deleted instead...

2010-10-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/addressbook/categories.js:
	(SIContactCategories.synchronizeFromServer): test
	propstat["prop"][0] to avoid an exception with servers that do not
	support the "contacts-categories" property.

2010-10-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/messenger/folders-update.js: trigger the
	synchronization of categories at startup.

	* chrome/content/addressbook/categories.js: new helper module
	providing synchronization methods with the SOGo server for
	categories.

	* chrome/content/addressbook/common-card-overlay.js: same as below
	for categories extracted from cards.

	* chrome/content/addressbook/folder-handler.js:

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/addressbook/addressbook-overlay.js:
	(SIAbDeleteDirectory): renamed from "onDeleteAbDirectory". Now

	url is now requested directly via the "serverURL" method.

2010-06-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Initial TB3.1 code

2010-06-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/global/common-dialog-overlay.js
	(_SIGetDialogType): added support for the "smtp" type.
	(SICommonDialogOnLoad): we reset the "tries" counter to 0 when the
	dialog has been popped up. We also only pop it up after 2 tries
	rather than only 1, since two SOGo dialog might popup at the same
	time.
	Finally, the checkbox status must be explicitly set to a boolean
	value.

2010-06-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/acl-dialog.js
	(_appendUserInList): order new items by keeping the special users
	entries at the end of the list.
	(onLoad): added code to asynchronously check if "/dav/public" is
	available before so that we knwo whether the "anonymous" user must
	be listed or not.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/folders-update.js:
	(directoryChecker.foldersFromResponse): we now check the returned
	objects for the "collection" resource type. If not present, we
	skip the entry.

	(userIDopenRolesWindowForUser): we now longer pass the "isDefault"
	parameter.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/roles-dialog.js
	(onLoad): same as below.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/addressbook/roles-dialog.js
	(onLoad): we now resize the window when the edited user is the
	special "anonymous" user. In that case, we also remove the
	modification rights since there is no case where we would like
	unauthenticated modification of a calendar.

2010-06-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/acl-dialog.js,
	chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/roles-dialog.js,
	chrome/content/sogo-integrator/addressbook/roles-dialog.js: added
	and modified code to handle public access rights as well as the

	(_confirmCreation): the creation operation is now performed from
	the opener window to avoid exceptions with lost XMLHttpRequest
	references.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/folder-handler.js:
	(CalendarHandler._setDirectoryProperties): default values for
	"suppressAlarms", "showInTodayPane" and "showInvitations" are set
	on new calendar folders.

2010-04-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-overlay.js:
	replace the "onclick" handle on the tree object, as what we really
	want to to is intercept anything causing a calendar to be added or
	removed outside our code. When catching the "onclick", we have no
	way of preventing the "mousedown" that triggers the "cyclecell"
	method from being invoked.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js
	(SubscriptionTreeView._parseUsersNode)
	(UsersTreeView._parseTreeNodes:): handle the case when the
	displayName of a returned user is empty.

2019-04-09  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	(checkExtensionsUpdate): new method that check for extensions
	update and open the update dialog only if an update is found.

2010-03-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js
	(onSubscriptionDialog): the "focus" event must be listened from
	the searchInput's inputField subelement in order to get caught.
	This would prevent tabfocus from cleaning the input.
	(onSearchInputKeyPress): we need to clean gSearchTimer when a
	search is launched by pressing "enter/return".
	(userReportTarget.onDAVQueryComplete)
	(collectionReportTarget.onDAVQueryComplete): we check the
	content-type of the result as well as its length prior to parse it
	as an XML document, to avoid exceptions.
	(userReportTarget.onDAVQueryComplete): a new element attribute
	("searching") is set to "notfound" when the query returned no
	result, enabling the setting of visual elements.

	calendars on calendars that we own.

2010-03-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js:
	"info" field can have multiple lines, which are then splitted and
	reassembled with a "; " separator.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/folders-update.js:
	check that "response" is non-null before processing, for sanity.

2010-03-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/properties-overlay.js
	(onLoadOverlay): we no longer disable the name field as we now
	permit the "renaming" of subscribed resources.

2009-12-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/folders-update.js
	(directoryChecker.checkAvailability): new methods that ensures
	that the corresponding SOGo module is available, by first
	executing an "OPTIONS" request on the container collection and
	then caching the result for further invocations.

	any SOGo-specific setup.

	We now correctly handle activation / desactivation of the menu
	items when dealing with local/webdav calendars
	* Bumped version to v0.98pre1

2009-11-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	added the ability to specify another prefix than "/SOGo", based on
	the "sogo-integrator.sogo-prefix" preference.

	(SubscriptionTreeView.toggleOpenState: removed the "filter"
	element from the query and close the "collection-filter" element

	logged a "malformed <data> element".

2009-07-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/startup-overlay.js:

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/startup-overlay.js:
	certain unavailable calendars may not return an "onLoad" when the
	network is down. Since the update window is no longer modal, we
	can redisplay it unconditionnally without fearing a deadlock.

2009-07-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*
	chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-summary-dialog.xul:
	new overlay, displaying the name of the item calendar in the upper
	right corner.

2009-07-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	that anyway.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/folder-handler.js: we no
	longer invoke "calCalendarManager.registerCalendar" since creating

	show the username being used to connect.

2008-12-03  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added a new overlay in order to control the
	visibility of the "Send attendees inviation by email"
	checkbox from Lightning. You can now show/hide by setting
